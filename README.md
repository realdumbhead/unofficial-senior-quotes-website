# unofficial-senior-quotes-website
student-run senior quotes website


Schools have restrictions regarding the content of senior quotes. I created this website as student-run unofficial version where seniors can put what ever they want in their quote. The websites uses a google form to fill out quotes and the spreadsheet from the quotes to view the quotes. I removed the quotes as they can be inappropriate at times. The view superlatives page does not work until at least one superlative is submitted.
